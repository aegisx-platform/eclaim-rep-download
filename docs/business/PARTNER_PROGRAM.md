## Revenue Sharing Models

### Model 1: Hybrid (Recommended for Implementation Partners)

**Best for:** Partners doing sales + installation + support

| Component | Partner Share | Vendor Share | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **License Fee** | 35% | 65% | One-time, on sale |
| **Installation** | 75% | 25% | Your labor, our technical support |
| **Training** | 80% | 20% | Your time on-site |
| **Year 1 Support** | 30% | 70% | Software updates + L2/L3 support |
| **Year 2+ Support** | 25% | 75% | Recurring, passive income |
| **Custom Development** | 50% | 50% | Project coordination vs. development |

**Example Calculation:**

```python
# Professional Package: 150,000 License + 40,000 Install + 30,000 AMS

# Year 1
license_revenue_partner = 150000 * 0.35  # = 52,500
install_revenue_partner = 40000 * 0.75   # = 30,000
ams_y1_revenue_partner = 30000 * 0.30    # = 9,000
year_1_total = 91,500

# Year 2-5 (each year)
ams_recurring_partner = 30000 * 0.25     # = 7,500 per year
year_2_to_5_total = 7500 * 4             # = 30,000

# 5-Year Lifetime Value
ltv_partner = 91500 + 30000              # = 121,500 per customer
```

### Model 2: Sales Agent

**Best for:** Partners doing sales only

| Component | Agent Share | Vendor Share |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **License Fee** | 20% | 80% |
| **Implementation** | 10% referral | 90% |
| **AMS Renewal** | 10% | 90% |

**No technical responsibilities** - vendor handles installation and support.

### Model 3: Volume Discount (for Strategic Partners)

**Best for:** Large distributors, HIS vendors

| Annual Volume | Wholesale Discount | Suggested Resale Margin |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1-10 licenses | 20% off list price | 15-25% margin |
| 11-30 licenses | 30% off list price | 20-30% margin |
| 31-50 licenses | 35% off list price | 25-35% margin |
| 51+ licenses | 40% off list price | 30-40% margin |

**Example:**
```
List Price: 150,000 (Professional Package)
Volume 20 licenses: 150,000 × 0.70 = 105,000 wholesale
Resale at: 135,000 → 30,000 margin (22%)
```
